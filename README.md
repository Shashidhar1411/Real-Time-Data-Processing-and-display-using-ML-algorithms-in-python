- Interactive development using Jupyter Notebook

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Socket Programming
- IPython.display
- Plotly
- PySerial
- Seaborn

## Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented

1. SDGC Classifier (Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier)
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Passive Aggressive Classifier
4. Perceptron Classifier
5. Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-data-processing.git
   cd real-time-data-processing

2.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3.Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4.Usage

5.Start the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

6.Run the client in a Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook client.ipynb
```

## Execute the cells in the notebook to process data and visualize results.
